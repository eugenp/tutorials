# Kubernetes Java API Sample Code

This module contains sample code used to show how to use the Kubernetes client Java API.

Before running those samples, make sure that your environment is correctly configured to access
a working Kubernetes cluster.

An easy way to check that everything is working as expected is issuing any *kubectl get* command:

```shell
$ kubectl get nodes
```
If you get a valid response, then you're good to go.
