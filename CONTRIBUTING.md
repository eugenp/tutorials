## Reporting Issues
Before you submit an issue, please review the guidelines below:

1. **No Custom Modifications:** If your issue arises from any custom modifications you've made to the code in the repository, we won't be able to assist. We can only help if the issue is reproducible with the untouched codebase from this repo. If you're working with a modified version, consider asking for help on StackOverflow or other relevant forums.
2. **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
3. **Include a link to the article** you're having issues with.
4. **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
5. **Additional Details:** Offer any other context or descriptions that could be useful. Screenshots, error messages, copy/pasteable snippets, or logs can be immensely helpful.
