The libraries module contains examples related to small libraries that are relatively easy to use and does not require any separate module of its own.

The code examples related to different libraries should go in a new package.

Remember, for advanced libraries like JUnit, Jackson, etc. we already have separate modules. Please make sure to have a look at the existing modules in such cases.
