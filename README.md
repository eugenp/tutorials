Java and Spring Tutorials
================

This project is **a collection of small and focused tutorials** - each covering a single and well defined area of development in the Java ecosystem. 
A strong focus of these is, of course, the Spring Framework - Spring, Spring Boot and Spring Security. 
In additional to Spring, the modules here are covering a number of aspects in Java. 


Building the project
====================
To do the full build, do: `mvn clean install`


Building a single module
====================
To build a specific module run the command: `mvn clean install` in the module directory


Running a Spring Boot module
====================
To run a Spring Boot module run the command: `mvn spring-boot:run` in the module directory


Working with the IDE
====================
This repo contains a large number of modules. 
When you're working with an individual module, there's no need to import all of them (or build all of them) - you can simply import that particular module in either Eclipse or IntelliJ. 


Running Tests
=============
The command `mvn clean install` will run the unit tests in a module.
To run the integration tests, use the command `mvn clean install -Pintegration-lite-first`
