## Profiles

Optionally the code can be run with the 'mongo' profile to use Mongo to store the projection. Otherwise, an in-memory
projection is used.

## Scripts

Two scripts are included to easily start middleware using Docker matching the properties files:

- `start_axon_server.sh` to start an Axon Server instance
- `start_mongo.sh` to start a MongoDB instance
