## Introduction
In this module, we delve into the fundamental concepts of object copying in Java. We discuss the differences between deep and shallow copies and explore scenarios where each type of copy is appropriate.

## Deep Copy
Learn how to create a deep copy of an object in Java and understand the implications of duplicating object structures, including nested objects.

## Shallow Copy
Explore the concept of shallow copy, where only the top-level object is duplicated, and references to nested objects are shared. Understand the potential challenges and benefits of using shallow copies.

## Examples
Get hands-on experience with practical examples that demonstrate how to implement both deep and shallow copies in Java. The examples provide clear insights into the code structure and usage patterns.

## Best Practices
Discover best practices for choosing between deep and shallow copies based on your application's requirements. Learn about potential pitfalls and how to avoid common mistakes when copying objects.

## Conclusion
Summarize key takeaways from the module and gain a solid understanding of when to use deep or shallow copies in Java development. Reflect on the importance of proper object copying for maintaining data integrity and efficiency in your programs.

Feel free to explore the code samples and experiment with different scenarios to reinforce your understanding of object copying in Java.

Happy Hacking!
