Create the FINAL developer documentation that incorporates and refines everything from the previous steps.
Your documentation should include:

1. **Overview**: Clear description of what the endpoint does and when to use it

2. **Technical Specification** (refined from step 1):
   - Endpoint details, methods, and parameters
   - Authentication requirements
   - Request/response schemas

3. **Examples** (polished from step 2):
   - Complete request/response examples
   - Edge cases and error scenarios
   - Curl commands and code snippets

4. **Integration Guide**:
   - Step-by-step implementation instructions
   - Best practices and recommendations
   - Common pitfalls to avoid

5. **Quick Reference**:
   - Status codes table
   - Required vs optional parameters
   - Business rules and constraints

Transform all the technical information into a single, cohesive documentation that is both comprehensive and developer-friendly.
Use clear formatting with headers, bullet points, and code blocks. Ensure nothing from the previous steps is lost, only reorganized and enhanced for clarity.
