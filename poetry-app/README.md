# introduction

A simple example for a clean hexagonal architecture.
It contains a use case model and command handlers that control the flow of the application.

This application has an in memory database and has a poet with name John whose 1 poem is tored in memory.
So when one queries the application and enters the aithor name as John, 
it displays the in memory poetry.

This is a gradle based application. Run the main class and
it will  simulate the display of poem written by author "John".
