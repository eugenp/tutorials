#
# DISCUSS: This may cause a major backwards compatibility issue, etc. but
#		   from a name space perspective, we probably should have prefaced
#		   all the property names with ESAPI or at least OWASP. Otherwise
#		   there could be problems is someone loads this properties file into
#		   the System properties.  We could also put this file into the
#		   esapi.jar file (perhaps as a ResourceBundle) and then allow an external
#		   ESAPI properties be defined that would overwrite these defaults.
#		   That keeps the application's properties relatively simple as usually
#		   they will only want to override a few properties. If looks like we
#		   already support multiple override levels of this in the
#		   DefaultSecurityConfiguration class, but I'm suggesting placing the
#		   defaults in the esapi.jar itself. That way, if the jar is signed,
#		   we could detect if those properties had been tampered with. (The
#		   code to check the jar signatures is pretty simple... maybe 70-90 LOC,
#		   but off course there is an execution penalty (similar to the way
#		   that the separate sunjce.jar used to be when a class from it was
#		   first loaded). Thoughts?

# WARNING: Operating system protection should be used to lock down the .esapi
# resources directory and all the files inside and all the directories all the
# way up to the root directory of the file system.  Note that if you are using
# file-based implementations, that some files may need to be read-write as they
# get updated dynamically.
#
# Before using, be sure to update the MasterKey and MasterSalt as described below.
# N.B.: If you had stored data that you have previously encrypted with ESAPI 1.4,
#		you *must* FIRST decrypt it using ESAPI 1.4 and then (if so desired)
#		re-encrypt it with ESAPI 2.0. If you fail to do this, you will NOT be
#		able to decrypt your data with ESAPI 2.0.
#
#		YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! More details are in the ESAPI 2.0 Release Notes.

# ESAPI Configuration
#
# If true, then print all the ESAPI properties set here when they are loaded.
# If false, they are not printed. Useful to reduce output when running JUnit tests.
# If you need to troubleshoot a properties related problem, turning this on may help.
# This is 'false' in the src/test/resources/.esapi version. It is 'true' by
# default for reasons of backward compatibility with earlier ESAPI versions.
ESAPI.printProperties=true
# ESAPI is designed to be easily extensible. You can use the reference implementation
# or implement your own providers to take advantage of your enterprise's security
# infrastructure. The functions in ESAPI are referenced using the ESAPI locator, like:
#
#    String ciphertext =
#		ESAPI.encryptor().encrypt("Secret message");   // Deprecated in 2.0
#    CipherText cipherText =
#		ESAPI.encryptor().encrypt(new PlainText("Secret message")); // Preferred
#
# Below you can specify the classname for the provider that you wish to use in your
# application. The only requirement is that it implement the appropriate ESAPI interface.
# This allows you to switch security implementations in the future without rewriting the
# entire application.

# ESAPI Encryption
#
# The ESAPI Encryptor provides basic cryptographic functions with a simplified API.
# To get started, generate a new key using java -classpath esapi.jar org.owasp.esapi.reference.crypto.JavaEncryptor
# There is not currently any support for key rotation, so be careful when changing your key and salt as it
# will invalidate all signed, encrypted, and hashed data.
#
# WARNING: Not all combinations of algorithms and key lengths are supported.
# If you choose to use a key length greater than 128, you MUST download the
# unlimited strength policy files and install in the lib directory of your JRE/JDK.
# See http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp for more information.
#
# Backward compatibility with ESAPI Java 1.4 is supported by the two deprecated API
# methods, Encryptor.encrypt(String) and Encryptor.decrypt(String). However, whenever
# possible, these methods should be avoided as they use ECB cipher mode, which in almost
# all circumstances a poor choice because of it's weakness. CBC cipher mode is the default
# for the new Encryptor encrypt / decrypt methods for ESAPI Java 2.0.  In general, you
# should only use this compatibility setting if you have persistent data encrypted with
# version 1.4 and even then, you should ONLY set this compatibility mode UNTIL
# you have decrypted all of your old encrypted data and then re-encrypted it with
# ESAPI 2.0 using CBC mode. If you have some reason to mix the deprecated 1.4 mode
# with the new 2.0 methods, make sure that you use the same cipher algorithm for both
# (256-bit AES was the default for 1.4; 128-bit is the default for 2.0; see below for
# more details.) Otherwise, you will have to use the new 2.0 encrypt / decrypt methods
# where you can specify a SecretKey. (Note that if you are using the 256-bit AES,
# that requires downloading the special jurisdiction policy files mentioned above.)
#
#		***** IMPORTANT: Do NOT forget to replace these with your own values! *****
# To calculate these values, you can run:
#		java -classpath esapi.jar org.owasp.esapi.reference.crypto.JavaEncryptor
#
Encryptor.MasterKey=tzfztf56ftv
Encryptor.MasterSalt=123456ztrewq
# Provides the default JCE provider that ESAPI will "prefer" for its symmetric
# encryption and hashing. (That is it will look to this provider first, but it
# will defer to other providers if the requested algorithm is not implemented
# by this provider.) If left unset, ESAPI will just use your Java VM's current
# preferred JCE provider, which is generally set in the file
# "$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security".
#
# The main intent of this is to allow ESAPI symmetric encryption to be
# used with a FIPS 140-2 compliant crypto-module. For details, see the section
# "Using ESAPI Symmetric Encryption with FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Modules" in
# the ESAPI 2.0 Symmetric Encryption User Guide, at:
# http://owasp-esapi-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.0-symmetric-crypto-user-guide.html
# However, this property also allows you to easily use an alternate JCE provider
# such as "Bouncy Castle" without having to make changes to "java.security".
# See Javadoc for SecurityProviderLoader for further details. If you wish to use
# a provider that is not known to SecurityProviderLoader, you may specify the
# fully-qualified class name of the JCE provider class that implements
# java.security.Provider. If the name contains a '.', this is interpreted as
# a fully-qualified class name that implements java.security.Provider.
#
# NOTE: Setting this property has the side-effect of changing it in your application
#       as well, so if you are using JCE in your application directly rather than
#       through ESAPI (you wouldn't do that, would you? ;-), it will change the
#       preferred JCE provider there as well.
#
# Default: Keeps the JCE provider set to whatever JVM sets it to.
Encryptor.PreferredJCEProvider=
# AES is the most widely used and strongest encryption algorithm. This
# should agree with your Encryptor.CipherTransformation property.
# By default, ESAPI Java 1.4 uses "PBEWithMD5AndDES" and which is
# very weak. It is essentially a password-based encryption key, hashed
# with MD5 around 1K times and then encrypted with the weak DES algorithm
# (56-bits) using ECB mode and an unspecified padding (it is
# JCE provider specific, but most likely "NoPadding"). However, 2.0 uses
# "AES/CBC/PKCSPadding". If you want to change these, change them here.
# Warning: This property does not control the default reference implementation for
#		   ESAPI 2.0 using JavaEncryptor. Also, this property will be dropped
#		   in the future.
# @deprecated
Encryptor.EncryptionAlgorithm=AES
#		For ESAPI Java 2.0 - New encrypt / decrypt methods use this.
Encryptor.CipherTransformation=AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
# Applies to ESAPI 2.0 and later only!
# Comma-separated list of cipher modes that provide *BOTH*
# confidentiality *AND* message authenticity. (NIST refers to such cipher
# modes as "combined modes" so that's what we shall call them.) If any of these
# cipher modes are used then no MAC is calculated and stored
# in the CipherText upon encryption. Likewise, if one of these
# cipher modes is used with decryption, no attempt will be made
# to validate the MAC contained in the CipherText object regardless
# of whether it contains one or not. Since the expectation is that
# these cipher modes support support message authenticity already,
# injecting a MAC in the CipherText object would be at best redundant.
#
# Note that as of JDK 1.5, the SunJCE provider does not support *any*
# of these cipher modes. Of these listed, only GCM and CCM are currently
# NIST approved. YMMV for other JCE providers. E.g., Bouncy Castle supports
# GCM and CCM with "NoPadding" mode, but not with "PKCS5Padding" or other
# padding modes.
Encryptor.cipher_modes.combined_modes=GCM,CCM,IAPM,EAX,OCB,CWC
# Applies to ESAPI 2.0 and later only!
# Additional cipher modes allowed for ESAPI 2.0 encryption. These
# cipher modes are in _addition_ to those specified by the property
# 'Encryptor.cipher_modes.combined_modes'.
# Note: We will add support for streaming modes like CFB & OFB once
# we add support for 'specified' to the property 'Encryptor.ChooseIVMethod'
# (probably in ESAPI 2.1).
# DISCUSS: Better name?
Encryptor.cipher_modes.additional_allowed=CBC
# 128-bit is almost always sufficient and appears to be more resistant to
# related key attacks than is 256-bit AES. Use '_' to use default key size
# for cipher algorithms (where it makes sense because the algorithm supports
# a variable key size). Key length must agree to what's provided as the
# cipher transformation, otherwise this will be ignored after logging a
# warning.
#
# NOTE: This is what applies BOTH ESAPI 1.4 and 2.0. See warning above about mixing!
Encryptor.EncryptionKeyLength=128
# Because 2.0 uses CBC mode by default, it requires an initialization vector (IV).
# (All cipher modes except ECB require an IV.) There are two choices: we can either
# use a fixed IV known to both parties or allow ESAPI to choose a random IV. While
# the IV does not need to be hidden from adversaries, it is important that the
# adversary not be allowed to choose it. Also, random IVs are generally much more
# secure than fixed IVs. (In fact, it is essential that feed-back cipher modes
# such as CFB and OFB use a different IV for each encryption with a given key so
# in such cases, random IVs are much preferred. By default, ESAPI 2.0 uses random
# IVs. If you wish to use 'fixed' IVs, set 'Encryptor.ChooseIVMethod=fixed' and
# uncomment the Encryptor.fixedIV.
#
# Valid values:		random|fixed|specified		'specified' not yet implemented; planned for 2.1
Encryptor.ChooseIVMethod=random
# If you choose to use a fixed IV, then you must place a fixed IV here that
# is known to all others who are sharing your secret key. The format should
# be a hex string that is the same length as the cipher block size for the
# cipher algorithm that you are using. The following is an *example* for AES
# from an AES test vector for AES-128/CBC as described in:
# NIST Special Publication 800-38A (2001 Edition)
# "Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation".
# (Note that the block size for AES is 16 bytes == 128 bits.)
#
Encryptor.fixedIV=0x000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f
# Whether or not CipherText should use a message authentication code (MAC) with it.
# This prevents an adversary from altering the IV as well as allowing a more
# fool-proof way of determining the decryption failed because of an incorrect
# key being supplied. This refers to the "separate" MAC calculated and stored
# in CipherText, not part of any MAC that is calculated as a result of a
# "combined mode" cipher mode.
#
# If you are using ESAPI with a FIPS 140-2 cryptographic module, you *must* also
# set this property to false.
