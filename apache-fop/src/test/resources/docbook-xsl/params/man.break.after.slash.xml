<para>If non-zero, line-breaking after slashes is enabled. This is
mainly useful for causing long URLs or pathnames/filenames to be
broken up or "wrapped" across lines (though it also has the side
effect of sometimes causing relatively short URLs and pathnames to be
broken up across lines too).</para>

<para>If zero (the default), line-breaking after slashes is
disabled. In that case, strings containing slashes (for example, URLs
or filenames) are not broken across lines, even if they exceed the
maximum column widith.</para>

<warning>
  <para>If you set a non-zero value for this parameter, check your
  man-page output carefuly afterwards, in order to make sure that the
  setting has not introduced an excessive amount of breaking-up of URLs
  or pathnames. If your content contains mostly short URLs or
  pathnames, setting a non-zero value for
  <parameter>man.break.after.slash</parameter> will probably result in
  in a significant number of relatively short URLs and pathnames being
  broken across lines, which is probably not what you want.</para>
