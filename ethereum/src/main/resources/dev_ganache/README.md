# Three Ways to Install Ganache

Ganache is provided in three libraries or distributions:

(1) Ganache - https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache

This is a pre-built and out-of-the-box solution. Easiest to set up. It provides an interface and server shell for Ganache CLI.

(2) Ganache CLI - https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli

Ganache CLI abstracts Ganache Core and supplies the default options and arguments used.

(3) Ganache Core - https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-core

Basically, only use Ganache Core if you need to build a totally customized option.

# Use

The default port is *8545* on *localhost*
