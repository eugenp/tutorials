Read the [Getting started page](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) for information on the framework contents, templates and examples, and more.

### What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```
bootstrap/
├── css/
│   ├── bootstrap.css
│   ├── bootstrap.css.map
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css.map
│   ├── bootstrap-theme.css
│   ├── bootstrap-theme.css.map
│   ├── bootstrap-theme.min.css
│   └── bootstrap-theme.min.css.map
├── js/
│   ├── bootstrap.js
│   └── bootstrap.min.js
└── fonts/
    ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot
    ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg
    ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf
    ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff
    └── glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff2
```

We provide compiled CSS and JS (`bootstrap.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`bootstrap.min.*`). CSS [source maps](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors) (`bootstrap.*.map`) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools. Fonts from Glyphicons are included, as is the optional Bootstrap theme.


## Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request? Please first read the [issue guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-the-issue-tracker) and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/new).

Note that **feature requests must target [Bootstrap v4](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v4-dev),** because Bootstrap v3 is now in maintenance mode and is closed off to new features. This is so that we can focus our efforts on Bootstrap v4.


## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://getbootstrap.com>. The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.
   **Note for Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.
2. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the command line.
4. Open `http://localhost:9001` in your browser, and voilà.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

### Documentation for previous releases

Documentation for v2.3.2 has been made available for the time being at <http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/> while folks transition to Bootstrap 3.

[Previous releases](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) and their documentation are also available for download.


## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Included are directions for opening issues, coding standards, and notes on development.

Moreover, if your pull request contains JavaScript patches or features, you must include [relevant unit tests](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/js/tests). All HTML and CSS should conform to the [Code Guide](https://github.com/mdo/code-guide), maintained by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).

**Bootstrap v3 is now closed off to new features.** It has gone into maintenance mode so that we can focus our efforts on [Bootstrap v4](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v4-dev), the future of the framework. Pull requests which add new features (rather than fix bugs) should target [Bootstrap v4 (the `v4-dev` git branch)](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v4-dev) instead.

Editor preferences are available in the [editor config](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/.editorconfig) for easy use in common text editors. Read more and download plugins at <http://editorconfig.org>.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See [the Releases section of our GitHub project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) for changelogs for each release version of Bootstrap. Release announcement posts on [the official Bootstrap blog](http://blog.getbootstrap.com) contain summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release.
