  /**
   * @ngdoc function
   * @name ui.router.util.$resolve#resolve
   * @methodOf ui.router.util.$resolve
   *
   * @description
   * Resolves a set of invocables. An invocable is a function to be invoked via 
   * `$injector.invoke()`, and can have an arbitrary number of dependencies. 
   * An invocable can either return a value directly,
   * or a `$q` promise. If a promise is returned it will be resolved and the 
   * resulting value will be used instead. Dependencies of invocables are resolved 
   * (in this order of precedence)
   *
   * - from the specified `locals`
   * - from another invocable that is part of this `$resolve` call
   * - from an invocable that is inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve` 
   *   (or recursively
   * - from any ancestor `$resolve` of that parent).
   *
   * The return value of `$resolve` is a promise for an object that contains 
   * (in this order of precedence)
   *
   * - any `locals` (if specified)
   * - the resolved return values of all injectables
   * - any values inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve` (if specified)
   *
   * The promise will resolve after the `parent` promise (if any) and all promises 
   * returned by injectables have been resolved. If any invocable 
   * (or `$injector.invoke`) throws an exception, or if a promise returned by an 
   * invocable is rejected, the `$resolve` promise is immediately rejected with the 
   * same error. A rejection of a `parent` promise (if specified) will likewise be 
   * propagated immediately. Once the `$resolve` promise has been rejected, no 
   * further invocables will be called.
   * 
   * Cyclic dependencies between invocables are not permitted and will cause `$resolve`
   * to throw an error. As a special case, an injectable can depend on a parameter 
   * with the same name as the injectable, which will be fulfilled from the `parent` 
   * injectable of the same name. This allows inherited values to be decorated. 
   * Note that in this case any other injectable in the same `$resolve` with the same
   * dependency would see the decorated value, not the inherited value.
   *
   * Note that missing dependencies -- unlike cyclic dependencies -- will cause an 
   * (asynchronous) rejection of the `$resolve` promise rather than a (synchronous) 
   * exception.
   *
   * Invocables are invoked eagerly as soon as all dependencies are available. 
   * This is true even for dependencies inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve`.
   *
   * As a special case, an invocable can be a string, in which case it is taken to 
   * be a service name to be passed to `$injector.get()`. This is supported primarily 
   * for backwards-compatibility with the `resolve` property of `$routeProvider` 
   * routes.
   *
   * @param {object} invocables functions to invoke or 
   * `$injector` services to fetch.
   * @param {object} locals  values to make available to the injectables
   * @param {object} parent  a promise returned by another call to `$resolve`.
   * @param {object} self  the `this` for the invoked methods
   * @return {object} Promise for an object that contains the resolved return value
   * of all invocables, as well as any inherited and local values.
