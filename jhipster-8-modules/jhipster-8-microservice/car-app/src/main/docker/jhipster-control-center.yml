## How to use JHCC docker compose
# To allow JHCC to reach JHipster application from a docker container note that we set the host as host.docker.internal
# To reach the application from a browser, you need to add '127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal' to your hosts file.
### Discovery mode
# JHCC support 3 kinds of discovery mode: Consul, Eureka and static
# In order to use one, please set SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE to one (and only one) of this values: consul,eureka,static
### Discovery properties
# According to the discovery mode choose as Spring profile, you have to set the right properties
# please note that current properties are set to run JHCC with default values, personalize them if needed
# and remove those from other modes. You can only have one mode active.
#### Eureka
#       - EUREKA_CLIENT_SERVICE_URL_DEFAULTZONE=http://admin:admin@host.docker.internal:8761/eureka/
#### Consul
#       - SPRING_CLOUD_CONSUL_HOST=host.docker.internal
#       - SPRING_CLOUD_CONSUL_PORT=8500
#### Static
# Add instances to "MyApp"
#       - SPRING_CLOUD_DISCOVERY_CLIENT_SIMPLE_INSTANCES_MYAPP_0_URI=http://host.docker.internal:8081
#       - SPRING_CLOUD_DISCOVERY_CLIENT_SIMPLE_INSTANCES_MYAPP_1_URI=http://host.docker.internal:8082
# Or add a new application named MyNewApp
#       - SPRING_CLOUD_DISCOVERY_CLIENT_SIMPLE_INSTANCES_MYNEWAPP_0_URI=http://host.docker.internal:8080
# This configuration is intended for development purpose, it's **your** responsibility to harden it for production

#### IMPORTANT
# If you choose Consul or Eureka mode:
# Do not forget to remove the prefix "127.0.0.1" in front of their port in order to expose them.
# This is required because JHCC need to communicate with Consul or Eureka.
# - In Consul mode, the ports are in the consul.yml file.
# - In Eureka mode, the ports are in the jhipster-registry.yml file.
