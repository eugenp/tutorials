Note that, unfortunately, we can only help with issues that are specifically and directly related to the article - not with your own, custom application.

StackOverflow is a great place to ask more general questions.

That's primarily because we get a large number of questions and - while we do try to go through as much as everything and help wherever we can, we can't really get back to all of them.
