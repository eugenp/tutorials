# You should always specify InitialToken when setting up a production

# The principle is that each node should be given an equal slice of

# for more details.
#
# If blank, Cassandra will request a token bisecting the range of

# available, such as is the case with a new cluster, it will pick
# a random token, which will lead to hot spots.

# Authentication backend, implementing IAuthenticator; used to identify users

# The partitioner is responsible for distributing rows (by key) across
# nodes in the cluster.  Any IPartitioner may be used, including your/m
# own as long as it is on the classpath.  Out of the box, Cassandra
# provides org.apache.cassandra.dht.{Murmur3Partitioner, RandomPartitioner
# ByteOrderedPartitioner, OrderPreservingPartitioner (deprecated)}.
#
# - RandomPartitioner distributes rows across the cluster evenly by md5.
#   This is the default prior to 1.2 and is retained for compatibility.
# - Murmur3Partitioner is similar to RandomPartioner but uses Murmur3_128
#   Hash Function instead of md5.  When in doubt, this is the best option.
# - ByteOrderedPartitioner orders rows lexically by key bytes.  BOP allows
#   scanning rows in key order, but the ordering can generate hot spots
#   for sequential insertion workloads.
# - OrderPreservingPartitioner is an obsolete form of BOP, that stores
# - keys in a less-efficient format and only works with keys that are
#   UTF8-encoded Strings.
# - CollatingOPP collates according to EN,US rules rather than lexical byte
#   ordering.  Use this as an example if you need custom collation.

#
# async -> Nonblocking server implementation with one thread to serve
#          rpc connections.  This is not recommended for high throughput use
#          cases. Async has been tested to be about 50% slower than sync
#          or hsha and is deprecated: it will be removed in the next major release.

# hsha  -> Stands for "half synchronous, half asynchronous." The rpc thread pool
#          (see below) is used to manage requests, but the threads are multiplexed
#          across the different clients.

# endpoint_snitch -- Set this to a class that implements
# IEndpointSnitch.  The snitch has two functions:
# - it teaches Cassandra enough about your network topology to route
#   requests efficiently
# - it allows Cassandra to spread replicas around your cluster to avoid
#   correlated failures. It does this by grouping machines into
#   "datacenters" and "racks."  Cassandra will do its best not to have
#   more than one replica on the same "rack" (which may not actually
#   be a physical location)
#
# IF YOU CHANGE THE SNITCH AFTER DATA IS INSERTED INTO THE CLUSTER,
# YOU MUST RUN A FULL REPAIR, SINCE THE SNITCH AFFECTS WHERE REPLICAS
# ARE PLACED.
#
# Out of the box, Cassandra provides
#  - SimpleSnitch:
#    Treats Strategy order as proximity. This improves cache locality
#    when disabling read repair, which can further improve throughput.
#    Only appropriate for single-datacenter deployments.
#  - PropertyFileSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
#    explicitly configured in cassandra-topology.properties.
#  - RackInferringSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
#    assumed to correspond to the 3rd and 2nd octet of each node's
#    IP address, respectively.  Unless this happens to match your
#    deployment conventions (as it did Facebook's), this is best used
#    as an example of writing a custom Snitch class.
#  - Ec2Snitch:
#    Appropriate for EC2 deployments in a single Region.  Loads Region
#    and Availability Zone information from the EC2 API. The Region is
#    treated as the Datacenter, and the Availability Zone as the rack.
#    Only private IPs are used, so this will not work across multiple
#    Regions.
#  - Ec2MultiRegionSnitch:
#    Uses public IPs as broadcast_address to allow cross-region
#    connectivity.  (Thus, you should set seed addresses to the public
#    IP as well.) You will need to open the storage_port or
#    ssl_storage_port on the public IP firewall.  (For intra-Region
#    traffic, Cassandra will switch to the private IP after
#    establishing a connection.)
