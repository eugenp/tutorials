## Spring Data MongoDB Live Testing


There are 3 scripts to simplify running live tests:
1. [`live-test-setup.sh`](src/live-test/resources/live-test-setup.sh) builds a docker image with the necessary setup and runs it. The environment is ready, when the log stops - it takes approximately 30 seconds.
2. [`live-test.sh`](src/live-test/resources/live-test.sh) runs the live tests (but no other tests).
3. [`live-test-teardown.sh`](src/live-test/resources/live-test-teardown.sh) stops and removes the docker image.
