	 * physical damage is given by E=H(100+A)/100, where H is health and A is
	 * armor. Health costs 2.5 gold per unit, and Armor costs 18 gold per unit.
	 * You have 3600 gold, and you need to optimize the effectiveness E of your
	 * health and armor to survive as long as possible against the enemy team's
	 * attacks. How much of each should you buy? <br>
	 * <br>
	 * The solution is H = 1080, A = 50 for a total fitness of 1620. Tested with
	 * 50 swarms each with 1000 particles.
