 * Specific fitness function implementation to solve the League of Legends

 * In League of Legends, a player's Effective Health when defending against
 * physical damage is given by E=H(100+A)/100, where H is health and A is armor.
 * Health costs 2.5 gold per unit, and Armor costs 18 gold per unit. You have
 * 3600 gold, and you need to optimize the effectiveness E of your health and
 * armor to survive as long as possible against the enemy team's attacks. How
 * much of each should you buy? <br>
