# lagom-cargotracker
A cargo tracker application built with Lagom.

The core concepts of reactive microservices have been introduced by Jonas Bon√©r in his report [Reactive Microservices Architecture](https://www.lightbend.com/reactive-microservices-architecture). [Lagom](http://lightbend.com/lagom) is the implementation of the described concepts. To find a good example to implement a Microservices based system with Lagom, we just needed to look into Eric Evans' book [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) and use the discussed example, the [Cargo Tracker](http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/). The example in this repository follows this idea and is meant to be a starting point to build a full blown Lagom based cargo tracker.
