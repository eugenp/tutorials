    <title>Tag Plugin Implementation</title>

    <h2>How to write tag plugins</h2>
    <p>
      To write a plugin, you'll need to download the source for Tomcat.
      There are two steps:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Implement the plugin class.<p/>
        This class, which implements
        <tt>org.apache.jasper.compiler.tagplugin.TagPlugin</tt>
        instructs Jasper what Java codes to generate in place of the tag
        handler calls.
        See Javadoc for <tt>org.apache.jasper.compiler.tagplugin.TagPlugin</tt>
        for details.
      </li>

      <li>
        Create the plugin descriptor file <tt> WEB-INF/tagPlugins.xml</tt><p/>
        This file
        specifies the plugin classes and their corresponding tag handler
        classes.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </body>
</html>
