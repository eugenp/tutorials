    <h1>JSP 2.0 SVG Example</h1>
    <hr>
    This example uses JSP 2.0's new, simplified JSPX syntax to render a
    Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) document.  When you view the source,
    notice the lack of a &lt;jsp:root&gt; element!  The text to be rendered
    can be modified by changing the value of the name parameter.
    <p>
    SVG has many potential uses, such as searchable images, or images
    customized with the name of your site's visitor (e.g. a "Susan's Store"
    tab image).  JSPX is a natural fit for generating dynamic XML content
    such as SVG.
    <p>
    To execute this example, follow these steps:
    <ol>
      <li>Download <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/index.html">Apache Batik</a>,
          or any other SVG viewer.</li>
      <li>Copy the following URL:
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/jsp2/jspx/textRotate.jspx?name=JSPX">
      http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/jsp2/jspx/textRotate.jspx?name=JSPX</a>
      </li>
      <li>Paste the URL into Batik's Location field and press Enter</li>
      <li>Customize by changing the name=JSPX parameter</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    The following is a screenshot of the resulting image, for those that
    don't have an SVG viewer:
    <blockquote>
      <img src="textRotate.jpg" border="1">
