<section name="Introduction">

<p>Tomcat uses JMX MBeans as the technology for implementing
manageability of Tomcat.</p>

<p>The descriptions of JMX MBeans for Catalina are in the mbeans-descriptors.xml
file in each package.</p>

<p>You will need to add MBean descriptions for your custom components
in order to avoid a "ManagedBean is not found" exception.</p>

</section>

<section name="Adding MBean descriptions">

<p>You may also add MBean descriptions for custom components in
a mbeans-descriptors.xml file, located in the same package as the class files
it describes.</p>

  &lt;mbean         name="LDAPRealm"
            className="org.apache.catalina.mbeans.ClassNameMBean"

               domain="Catalina"
                group="Realm"
                 type="com.myfirm.mypackage.LDAPRealm"&gt;
