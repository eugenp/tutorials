<section name="Catalina Functional Specifications">

<p>This documentation area includes <em>functional specifications</em> for
many features supported by the <strong>Catalina</strong> servlet container
portion of Tomcat.  In most cases, these features are not documented in the
underlying Servlet or JSP specifications, so a definition of the expected
correct behavior is important both to implementors of those features, and to
test writers trying to decide what to test.</p>

<p>The functional specifications are divided into the following categories
in the menu (to the left):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Administrative Apps</em> - Overall requirements for supporting an
    ability to configure and operate a Tomcat installation through tools,
    as well as detailed requirements for the tools themselves.</li>
<li><em>Internal Servlets</em> - Requirements for Catalina features that are
    implemented as internal, container-managed, servlets.</li>
<li><em>Realm Implementations</em> - Requirements for the implementations of
    the <code>org.apache.catalina.Realm</code> interface (providing access to
    collections of users, passwords and roles) that are included in the
    standard Tomcat distribution.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>NOTE</em> - In some cases, the contents of these functional specs has
been "reverse engineered" from existing implementations.  This exercise is
still useful, because it provides an introduction to <strong>what</strong>
Catalina does, without being as concerned with <strong>how</strong> this is
accomplished.</p>

<p><strong>TODO</strong> - Obviously, this area has a long ways to go before
it is complete.  Contributions are welcome!</p>
