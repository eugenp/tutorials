  <section name="Assumptions">
    <p>
      For the sake of this how-to, assume you have a development host with two
      host names, <code>ren</code> and <code>stimpy</code>. Let's also assume
      one instance of Tomcat running, so <code>$CATALINA_HOME</code> refers to
      wherever it's installed, perhaps <code>/usr/local/tomcat</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, this how-to uses Unix-style path separators and commands; if you're
      on Windows modify accordingly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section name="server.xml">
    <p>
      At the simplest, edit the <a href="config/engine.html">Engine</a> portion
      of your <code>server.xml</code> file to look like this:
    </p>
    <source>
&lt;Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="ren"&gt;
    &lt;Host name="ren"    appBase="renapps"/&gt;
    &lt;Host name="stimpy" appBase="stimpyapps"/&gt;
&lt;/Engine&gt;
    </source>
    <p>
      Note that the directory structures under the appBase for each host should
      not overlap each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consult the configuration documentation for other attributes of the
      <a href="config/engine.html">Engine</a> and <a href="config/host.html">
      Host</a> elements.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section name="Webapps Directory">
    <p>
      Create directories for each of the virtual hosts:
    </p>
    <source>
mkdir $CATALINA_HOME/renapps
mkdir $CATALINA_HOME/stimpyapps
    </source>
  </section>

  <section name="Configuring Your Contexts">
    <subsection name="General">
      <p>Contexts are normally located underneath the appBase directory. For
       example, to deploy the <code>foobar</code> context as a war file in
       the <code>ren</code> host, use
       <code>$CATALINA_HOME/renapps/foobar.war</code>. Note that the
       default or ROOT context for <code>ren</code> would be deployed as
       <code>$CATALINA_HOME/renapps/ROOT.war</code> (WAR) or
       <code>$CATALINA_HOME/renapps/ROOT</code> (directory).
      </p>
      <p><strong>NOTE: The <code>docBase</code> for a context should never be
        the same as the <code>appBase</code> for a host.</strong>
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="context.xml - approach #1">
      <p>
        Within your Context, create a <code>META-INF</code> directory and then
        place your Context definition in it in a file named
        <code>context.xml</code>. i.e.
        <code>$CATALINA_HOME/renapps/ROOT/META-INF/context.xml</code>
        This makes deployment easier, particularly if you're distributing a WAR
        file.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="context.xml - approach #2">
      <p>
        Create a structure under <code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina</code>
        corresponding to your virtual hosts, e.g.:
      </p>
      <source>
mkdir $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/ren
mkdir $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/stimpy
      </source>
      <p>
        Note that the ending directory name "Catalina" represents the
        <code>name</code> attribute of the
        <a href="config/engine.html">Engine</a> element as shown above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, for your default webapps, add:
      </p>
      <source>
$CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/ren/ROOT.xml
$CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/stimpy/ROOT.xml
      </source>
      <p>
        If you want to use the Tomcat manager webapp for each host, you'll also
        need to add it here:
      </p>
      <source>
cd $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina
cp localhost/manager.xml ren/
cp localhost/manager.xml stimpy/
      </source>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Further Information">
      <p>
        Consult the configuration documentation for other attributes of the
        <a href="config/context.html">Context</a> element.
      </p>
    </subsection>
