    <attributes>
      <attribute name="className" required="true">
        The cluster deployer class, currently only one is available,
        <code>org.apache.catalina.ha.deploy.FarmWarDeployer.</code>
      </attribute>
      <attribute name="deployDir" required="true">
        Deployment directory. This is the pathname of a directory where deploy
        the web applications. You may specify an absolute pathname, or a
        pathname that is relative to the $CATALINA_BASE directory. In the
        current implementation, this attribute must be the same value as the
        <strong>Host's appBase</strong>.
      </attribute>
      <attribute name="tempDir" required="true">
        The temporaryDirectory to store binary data when downloading a war from
        the cluster. You may specify an absolute pathname, or a pathname that is
        relative to the $CATALINA_BASE directory.
      </attribute>
      <attribute name="watchDir" required="false">
        This is the pathname of a directory where watch for changes(add/modify/remove)
        of web applications. You may specify an absolute pathname, or a pathname
        that is relative to the $CATALINA_BASE directory.
        <strong>Note: </strong> if <strong>watchEnabled</strong> is false, this
        attribute will have no effect.
      </attribute>
      <attribute name="watchEnabled" required="false">
        Set to true if you want to watch for changes of web applications.
        Only when this attribute set to true, you can trigger a deploy/undeploy
        of web applications. The flag's value defaults to false.
      </attribute>
      <attribute name="processDeployFrequency" required="false">
        Frequency of the Farm watchDir check. Cluster wide deployment will be
        done once for the specified amount of backgroundProcess calls (ie, the
        lower the amount, the most often the checks will occur). The minimum
        value is 1, and the default value is 2.
        <strong>Note: </strong> if <strong>watchEnabled</strong> is false, this
        attribute will have no effect.
      </attribute>
      <attribute name="maxValidTime" required="false">
        The maximum valid time(in seconds) of FileMessageFactory.
        FileMessageFactory will be removed immediately after receiving the
        complete WAR file but when failing to receive a FileMessage which was
        sent dividing, FileMessageFactory will leak without being removed.
        FileMessageFactory that is leaking will be automatically removed after
        maxValidTime. If a negative value specified, FileMessageFactory will
        never be removed. If the attribute is not provided, a default of 300
        seconds (5 minutes) is used.
