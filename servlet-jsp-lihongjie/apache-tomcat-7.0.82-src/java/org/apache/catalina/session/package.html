<body>

<p>This package contains the standard <code>Manager</code> and
<code>Session</code> implementations that represent the collection of
active sessions and the individual sessions themselves, respectively,
that are associated with a <code>Context</code>.  Additional implementations
of the <code>Manager</code> interface can be based upon the supplied
convenience base class (<code>ManagerBase</code>), if desired.  Different
implementations of <code>Session</code> are possible, but a need for
functionality beyond what is provided by the standard implementation
(<code>StandardSession</code>) is not expected.</p>

<p>The convenience <code>ManagerBase</code> base class is configured by
setting the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>algorithm</b> - Message digest algorithm to be used when
    generating session identifiers.  This must be the name of an
    algorithm supported by the <code>java.security.MessageDigest</code>
    class on your platform.  [DEFAULT_ALGORITHM]</li>
<li><b>debug</b> - Debugging detail level for this component. [0]</li>
<li><b>distributable</b> - Has the web application we are associated with
    been marked as "distributable"?  If it has, attempts to add or replace
    a session attribute object that does not implement the
    <code>java.io.Serializable</code> interface will be rejected.
    [false]</li>
<li><b>maxInactiveInterval</b> - The default maximum inactive interval,
    in minutes, for sessions created by this Manager.  The standard
    implementation automatically updates this value based on the configuration
    settings in the web application deployment descriptor.  [60]</li>
<li><b>randomClass</b> - The Java class name of the random number generator
    to be used when creating session identifiers for this Manager.
    [java.security.SecureRandom]</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard implementation of the <code>Manager</code> interface
(<code>StandardManager</code>) supports the following additional configuration
properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>checkInterval</b> - The interval, in seconds, between checks for
    sessions that have expired and should be invalidated.  [60]</li>
<li><b>maxActiveSessions</b> - The maximum number of active sessions that
    will be allowed, or -1 for no limit.  [-1]</li>
<li><b>pathname</b> - Pathname to the file that is used to store session
    data persistently across container restarts.  If this pathname is relative,
    it is resolved against the temporary working directory provided by our
    associated Context, if any.  ["sessions.ser"]</li>
</ul>
