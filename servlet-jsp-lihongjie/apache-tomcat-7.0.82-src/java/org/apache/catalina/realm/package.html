<body>

<p>This package contains <code>Realm</code> implementations for the
various supported realm technologies for authenticating users and
identifying their associated roles.  The <code>Realm</code> that is
associated with a web application's <code>Context</code> (or a hierarchically
superior Container) is used to resolve authentication and role presence
questions when a web application uses container managed security as described
in the Servlet API Specification, version 2.2.</p>

<p>The implementations share a common base class that supports basic
functionality for all of the standard <code>Realm</code> implementations.</p>
