abstractProcessor.isCloseFail=Failed to close input stream associated with upgraded connection
abstractProcessor.onDataAvailableFail=Failed to process data available event
abstractProcessor.onWritePossibleFail=Failed to process write possible event
abstractProcessor.osCloseFail=Failed to close output stream associated with upgraded connection

upgrade.sis.isFinished.ise=It is illegal to call isFinished() when the ServletInputStream is not in non-blocking mode (i.e. setReadListener() must be called first)
upgrade.sis.isReady.ise=It is illegal to call isReady() when the ServletInputStream is not in non-blocking mode (i.e. setReadListener() must be called first)
upgrade.sis.readListener.null=It is illegal to pass null to setReadListener()
upgrade.sis.readListener.set=It is illegal to call setReadListener() more than once for the same upgraded connection
upgrade.sis.read.ise=It is illegal to call any of the read() methods in non-blocking mode without first checking that there is data available by calling isReady()
upgrade.sos.canWrite.ise=It is illegal to call canWrite() when the ServletOutputStream is not in non-blocking mode (i.e. setWriteListener() must be called first)
upgrade.sos.writeListener.null=It is illegal to pass null to setWriteListener()
upgrade.sos.writeListener.set=It is illegal to call setWriteListener() more than once for the same upgraded connection
upgrade.sis.write.ise=It is illegal to call any of the write() methods in non-blocking mode without first checking that there is space available by calling isReady()

apr.clientAbort=The client aborted the connection.
apr.read.error=Unexpected error [{0}] reading data from the APR/native socket [{1}] with wrapper [{2}].
apr.read.sslGeneralError=An APR general error was returned by the SSL read operation on APR/native socket [{0}] with wrapper [{1}]. It will be treated as EAGAIN and the socket returned to the poller.
apr.write.error=Unexpected error [{0}] writing data to the APR/native socket [{1}] with wrapper [{2}].
apr.closed=The socket [{0}] associated with this connection has been closed.

nio.eof.error=Unexpected EOF read on the socket
