<H1>Buffers and Encodings</h1>

This package contains buffers and utils to perform encoding/decoding of buffers. That includes byte to char
conversions, URL encodings, etc.

<p>
Encoding is a critical operation for performance. There are few tricks in this package - the C2B and
B2C converters are caching a ISReader/OSWriter and keep everything allocated to do the conversions
in any VM without any garbage.

<p>
This package must accomodate future extensions and additional converters ( most important: the nio.charset,
which should be detected and used if available ). Also, we do have one hand-written UTF8Decoder, and
other tuned encoders could be added.

<p>
My benchmarks ( I'm costin :-) show only small differences between C2B, B2C and hand-written codders/decoders,
so UTF8Decoder may be disabled.
