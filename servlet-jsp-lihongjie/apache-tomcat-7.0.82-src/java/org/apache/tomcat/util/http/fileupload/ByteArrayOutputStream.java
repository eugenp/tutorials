/**
 * This class implements an output stream in which the data is
 * written into a byte array. The buffer automatically grows as data
 * is written to it.
 * <p>
 * The data can be retrieved using <code>toByteArray()</code> and
 * <code>toString()</code>.
 * <p>
 * Closing a <tt>ByteArrayOutputStream</tt> has no effect. The methods in
 * this class can be called after the stream has been closed without
 * generating an <tt>IOException</tt>.
 * <p>
 * This is an alternative implementation of the {@link java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream}
 * class. The original implementation only allocates 32 bytes at the beginning.
 * As this class is designed for heavy duty it starts at 1024 bytes. In contrast
 * to the original it doesn't reallocate the whole memory block but allocates
 * additional buffers. This way no buffers need to be garbage collected and
 * the contents don't have to be copied to the new buffer. This class is
 * designed to behave exactly like the original. The only exception is the
 * deprecated toString(int) method that has been ignored.
