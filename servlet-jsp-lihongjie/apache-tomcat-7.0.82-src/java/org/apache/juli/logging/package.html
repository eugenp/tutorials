<h3>Overview</h3>


<p>This implementation of commons-logging uses a  commons-logging.jar
 specific to a particular logging framework, instead of discovery. This takes 
out the guessing, is simpler, faster and more robust. Just like you chose a 
logging implementation, you should also use a matching commons-logging - for
example you download log4j.jar and commons-logging-log4j.jar, or use jdk 
logging and use commons-logging-jdk.jar.</p>

<p>A similar packaging is used by Eclipse SWT - they provide a common widget API,
 but each platform uses a different implementation jar - instead of using a complex 
 discovery/plugin mechanism.
</p> 

<p>This package generates commons-logging-jdk14.jar - i.e. the java.util implementation
of commons-logging api.<p>
