/**
 * Ensures that servlets handle only one request at a time. This interface has
 * no methods.
 * <p>
 * If a servlet implements this interface, you are <i>guaranteed</i> that no two
 * threads will execute concurrently in the servlet's <code>service</code>
 * method. The servlet container can make this guarantee by synchronizing access
 * to a single instance of the servlet, or by maintaining a pool of servlet
 * instances and dispatching each new request to a free servlet.
 * <p>
 * Note that SingleThreadModel does not solve all thread safety issues. For
 * example, session attributes and static variables can still be accessed by
 * multiple requests on multiple threads at the same time, even when
 * SingleThreadModel servlets are used. It is recommended that a developer take
 * other means to resolve those issues instead of implementing this interface,
 * such as avoiding the usage of an instance variable or synchronizing the block
 * of the code accessing those resources. This interface is deprecated in
 * Servlet API version 2.4.
 * 
 * @author Various
 * @deprecated As of Java Servlet API 2.4, with no direct replacement.
