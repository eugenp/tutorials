Classes and interfaces for the definition of JavaServer Pages Tag Libraries.

<p>
The JavaServer Pages(tm) (JSP) 2.0 specification provides a portable
mechanism for the description of tag libraries.
<p>
A JSP tag library contains
<ul>
<li>A Tag Library Descriptor</li>
<li>A number of Tag Files or Tag handler classes defining 
    request-time behavior</li>
<li>Additional classes and resources used at runtime</li>
<li>Possibly some additional classes to provide extra translation 
    information</li>
</ul>
<p>
The JSP 2.0 specification and the reference implementation both contain
simple and moderately complex examples of actions defined using this
mechanism.  These are available at JSP's web site, at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">http://java.sun.com/products/jsp</a>.
Some readers may want to consult those to get a quick feel for how
the mechanisms work together.
