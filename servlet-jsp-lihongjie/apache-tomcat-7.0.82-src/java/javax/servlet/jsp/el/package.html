Classes and interfaces for the JSP 2.0 Expression Language API.

<p>
The JavaServer Pages(tm) (JSP) 2.0 specification provides a portable
API for evaluating "EL Expressions".  As of JSP 2.0, EL expressions can
be placed directly in the template text of JSP pages and tag files.
<p>
This package contains a number of classes and interfaces that describe 
and define programmatic access to the Expression Language evaluator. 
This API can also be used by an implementation of JSP to evaluate the 
expressions, but other implementations, like open-coding into Java 
bytecodes, are allowed.  This package is intended to have no dependencies 
on other portions of the JSP 2.0 specification.
