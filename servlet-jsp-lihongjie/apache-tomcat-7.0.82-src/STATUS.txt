PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54330
  Refactor Member interface to reduce dependency on concrete implementation.
  Based on a patch by Greg Turnquist.
  I have added this to the status file because it changes an interface. I don't
  believe there is any harm in this - the interface isn't really usable prior to
  this patch - but I'd prefer this change to be RTC.
