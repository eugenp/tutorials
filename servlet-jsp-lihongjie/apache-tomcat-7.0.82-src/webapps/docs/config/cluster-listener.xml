<section name="org.apache.catalina.ha.session.JvmRouteSessionIDBinderListener">
  <p>
   Listens for session Id changes. This listener is only used if you are using mod_jk
   along with the <code>jvmRoute</code> attribute where the session Id can change.
   In the event of a change, the <code>JvmRouteBinderValve</code> will broadcast the
   session change and it will get picked up by this listener.
