<section name="Using Apache HTTP Server 2.x with mod_proxy">

Please refer to the mod_proxy documentation for Apache HTTP Server 2.2. This supports either
HTTP or AJP load balancing. This new version of mod_proxy is also usable with
Apache HTTP Server 2.0, but mod_proxy will have to be compiled separately using the code
from Apache HTTP Server 2.2.
