      Tomcat snapshots are located in the
      <a href="http://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/tomcat/">Apache Snapshot Repository</a>.
      The official URL is <source>http://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/tomcat/</source>
      Snapshots are done periodically, not on a regular basis, but when changes happen and the Tomcat team deems a new snapshot might
      useful.
