  - package-list files in API documentation (javadoc) are generated

  - bug52121-part1, bug52121-part2 files in tests are test data for a hard
    to reproduce testcase and should be used as is.

  - other trivial test files, such as textual files containing only "OK' string,
    are also excluded.

  - local build configuration files

  - file fragments that are combined during the build process and therefore can
    not contain a license header in every fragment
